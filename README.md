# Node-Hipchat-Logger
Nodejs Hipchat Logger - Get up to 100 messages every 5 minutes directly from your node app to a [hipchat](https://hipchat.com/) room.

A great tool to make development easier when running apps on remote environments.

__Note:__ Detailed instructions on how to use and working code to come shortly!

### Notes:

 - __Storage?__ Should I use redis to store the permanent access token (valid until 2022) retrieved from hipchat?   
 - Is there a url I can send a request to, in order to retrieve this [personal access token](https://developer.atlassian.com/hipchat/guide/hipchat-rest-api/api-access-tokens)?
 - If there isn't, how can I make my project any better/different from [nkohari](https://github.com/nkohari/node-hipchat)?
